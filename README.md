### Project Description: 
> In this project, we try to observe pruned subnetworks derived from original networks which can output commensurate accuracy compared to the original network. We try to observe the above over 2 network architectures - the LeNet architecture and a feed-forward multi-layer perceptron (MLP).
> We also try to look into the aspects of transfer learning using these pruned subnetworks (called the _Lottery Tickets_) over a dataset pertaining to the same domain.
